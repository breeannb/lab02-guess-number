        <h1>Guess the Number!</h1> 
        <p>Directions: Take a guess and see if you can get the right number. You can guess anywhere between 1 - 20. This can include the numbers 1 and 20 as well. You will only have 4 guesses, so make them count! We'll also give you some hints if you are too high or too low in the message at the bottom of the screen.</p>
